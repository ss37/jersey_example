Simple JAX-RS example using Jersey and Maven

**JAX-RS** or **Java API for RESTful Web Services** is an architecture that offers interchange of information over a stateless communication protocol like HTTP. Its simplicity lies in the fact that it can send requests with the help of HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

I created a JAX-RS example using Jersey and Maven. Jersey is an open-source framework that offers an API to easily develop and run a JAX-RS. Maven is a tool that helps organise and build your projects. It is extremely helpful when you have many projects to build and reference, which very commonly occurs in large-scale Java applications.

**Technology:** Java, Jersey JAX-RS, Maven, POJO
